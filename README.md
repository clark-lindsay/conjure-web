# conjure-web

This is a static web app, built with Svelte, to host the logic from my "conjure5e" npm package.
The purpose of the package is to simplify and codify the use and rules of certain tricky spells in the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons.
For more information on the npm package, see the [repo](https://github.com/clark-lindsay/Conjure5e) for that project.
